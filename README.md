### Context
While working with a customer in an air-gapped environment, I noticed that the ```./o11y-save-images.sh -i o11y-images.txt -f o11y-images.tar.gz``` script takes a significant amount of time to pull images and create the .tar file. To address this, I modified the script to pull images in parallel.

Pulling images with 4 concurrent pulls and compressing zip with fastest compression(gzip -1).

This will reduce the time needed for pulling and compressing images by **~40%.**  
This improvement has been tested on a Droplet.

Please test it and let me know if adding concurrent image pulling to the script would be worthwhile.

Also I don't see a significant difference in performance when pulling images in parallel using `docker pull`. Therefore, I think itâ€™s better to pull the images in parallel.See the below graph for reference.

We can also adjust the number of concurrent image pulls as needed.
